This is the MacBook application version of [animecix.net](https://animecix.net).

Built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and written in TypeScript.

## Features

## Installation

1. Visit the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/CaptainSP/animecix-desktop/releases) page
2. Download the most recent `.dmg` file
3. Double-click the downloaded file to open it
4. Drag the application icon to your `Applications` folder

## Development

Ensure NodeJS is installed on your system.

Then modify the following file:

Change "node:path" to "path" in the file contents.
